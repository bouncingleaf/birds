# Jessica Roy's Final Project for MET CS 767

## About

This is Jessica Roy's Final Project for Boston University MET CS 602 online, Professor Eric Braude, fall term 1 of 2018. It is a convolutional neural network to classify bird images from the CUB-200-2011 dataset by species.

## Contents

- nn.py - The neural net
- image_preparation.py - The program for preparing the images. It takes a few minutes to run, and it only needs to be run once.

## Running

### To prepare the neural net to run:

1. Get the CUB-200-2011 dataset.
2. Edit image_preparation.py to reflect where it is installed
3. Run image_preparation.py. This will normalize the image files and crop them to the bounding boxes.
It also produces text files the neural net training program can use.
